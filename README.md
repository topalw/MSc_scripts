# MSc_scripts
Scripts that I used during my MSc thesis are uploaded here to help me remember or as a reference for other begginers

## PCA_PCoa.r
A script that goes throught the main steps of conducting a Principal Component Analysis using SNPRelate and creates a plot of PC1 and PC2:PC4. It also transforms SNPRelates beta estimators of relatedness to distances and performs a PCoA on the distance matrix. It plots that too. Both need a tab-delimited file with two columns, one being individual names and the other population information (no header).

## msprime_simulation.py
A (quite intuitively) msprime-simulator scenario used for the testing of psmc.
